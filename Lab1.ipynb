    "Welcome to Supply Chain Modelling and Optimisation 2021! This unit introduces \r\n",
    "- key concepts and activities in the areas of logistics and supply chain management and establishes the distinct role each plays in industrial modelling and optimisation, \r\n",
    "- basic skills in analysing, classifying and solving the fundamental components of inventory systems are developed using both single and multi-commodity deterministic and stochastic models, \r\n",
    "- forecasting techniques and practices.\r\n",

    "### Why Python and Jupyter?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Python** is an interpreted, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. It has a strong position in scientific computing with a large community of users and available documentation. With an extensive ecosystem of scientific libraries and environments such as **numpy**, **scipy**, and **matplotlib**, it allows user to work on various scientific topics, especially computer science, mathematics, statistics, and optimisation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Jupyter** provides the web-based notebook application, which allows user to write, run, display, and document the output produced by the code. This means that we are able to capture the entire workflow in a single file, which can be saved, restored, and reused later on.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to introduce the basic idea of scientific computing using Python.\r\n",

    "### Indefinite Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "For definite loop, we have to identify how many iterations there are. This is working just fine as long as the number of iterations is not large, or worse, the number of iterations is unknown or predefined by some conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be much more advantageous if the computer could take care of counting the numbers of iterations for us. However, the for loop is no longer feasible as it is a definite looop in which the number of iterations is determined when the loop starts. The solution to this lies in another kind of loop, the indefinite or conditional loop. An indefinite loop keeps iterating until certain conditions are met. But do keep in mind that there is no guarantee ahead of time regarding how many times the loop will go around.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an indefinite loop is implemented using a while statement\n",

    "while $<$condition$>$: <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$<$body$>$ <br>\n",

    "Our quadratic program uses decision structures to avoid taking the square root of a negative number and generating an error at runtime. This is a common pattern in many programs: using decisions to protect against rare but possible errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the quadratic solver, we checked the data before the call to the sqrt function. Sometimes programs become so peppered with decisions to check for special cases that the main algorithm for handling the run-of-the-mill cases seems completely lost. Programming language designers have come up with mechanisms for exception handling that help to solve this design problem. The idea of an exception-handling mechanism is that the programmer can write code that catches and deals with errors that arise when the program is running. Rather than explicitly checking that each step in the algorithm was successful, a program with exception handling can in essence say, \"Do these steps, and if any problem crops up, handle it this way.\" \n",
